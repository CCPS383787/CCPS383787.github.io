    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am working towards getting a bachelorâ€™s degree in a medical field. My experiences through other classes will help me work hard to earn my degree. I am working towards these goals by taking classes in high school that will help me be prepared for classes and subject material in college. I am working towards taking the required classes to graduate high school and get into a college of my choosing. I am working towards completing all the requirements for a Bright Future scholarship. The values that I consider necessary for my success are independence, determination, creativity, the ability to work well with others, and the ability to lead others. These values are what I believe to make a great person. The short term goals I hope to achieve in the near feature are getting a job that pays well but is also flexible with my school and extracurricular schedule. This goal will help me learn how to time manage more effectively while also learning how to balance multiple things at the same time, while still do well in them. The character traits and achievements I want to be most know for is my perseverance, hard work, and my ability to work well with others. These traits will make me an outstanding person who others will want to look up to and learn from. These traits will make me helpful and important to have as a team member.</p>
